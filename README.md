Project Overview:
Our team of three collaborated to set up a GitHub workflow for efficient project management. We configured SSH keys, created a shared repository, and used GitHub Project to track tasks using the Development Board.

Workflow: 

Repository Setup: Initialized a private GitHub repository and configured SSH access.

Task Management: Used GitHub Projects's Development Board with To Do, In Progress, and Done columns.

Collaboration: Created branches, submitted pull requests, and conducted code reviews.

"Hello World" Web App:

Developed a simple web application displaying "Hello World" using HTML. Followed a structured workflow:
